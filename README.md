# Parallel and Distributed Computation

Simpar - simlation of the interaction between particles in a spherical envirment. Project developed to developed a deep understanding of the mechanism of parallel and distributed computation computation.

The development of the program uses MPI to achieve distribution computation in a cluster of CPU and OpenMP inside each proccess, to fully use all the available threads in a CPU.
